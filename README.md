### Introduction
This is a basic checkers game made with pyglet in Python. Developed during the 2017 Hack UTA Hackathon by Luke Hardin and Eli Jester. We attempted to create an AI by implementing a genetic algorithm (courtesy of Eli) which would begin to understand better moves for the AI. However, AI does not seem to be improving at all... This code is a reflection of our work in an exhausted and possibly delerious state and is in no way a refletion of our actual abilities.
